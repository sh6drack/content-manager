    website: "https://tiffanyzhong.com",
    notes: "Founded Zebra IQ to decode Gen Z behavior for brands like Snapchat and Levi's using real-time community insights. Also runs Pineapple Capital, an early-stage consumer fund. CCX's ability to measure 'what things weigh in someone's life from how they talk about it' is a more sophisticated, AI-native version of the consumer intelligence she's built her career around. WaxFeed's 26 listener archetypes would immediately click with someone who builds behavioral segmentation for a living."

/**
 * OUTREACH STRATEGY NOTES:
 *
 * Tier 1 - Highest Conviction (lead with neuroscience depth):
 * - Vivienne Ming, Demis Hassabis, Rosalind Picard, HEKA Fund, PsyMed Ventures
 * - These people LIVE in computational neuroscience. Lead with the Yeo 7-network
 *   model, spreading activation, and Bayesian memory. They'll read the papers.
 *
 * Tier 2 - Domain Match (lead with vertical application):
 * - Music: Troy Carter, Guy Oseary, Scooter Braun, Sophie Bendz, Spoti Angels
 *   Lead with WaxFeed: 553k albums, 26 listener archetypes, no retraining needed.
 * - Healthcare: David Ebersman, What If Ventures, Hopelab, Bryan Roberts
 *   Lead with behavioral drift detection. Clinical validation path.
 * - Podcast/Media: Alexis Ohanian, Zeev Ventures
 *   Lead with AVDP and conversational analysis capabilities.
 *
 * Tier 3 - Platform/Infrastructure (lead with domain-agnostic deployment):
 * - Jeff Dean, Elad Gil, Andrew Ng, Naval Ravikant, Jason Calacanis, Erik Torenberg
 *   Lead with "deployed across 4 domains without retraining" and 2 patents.
 *   These investors see hundreds of AI companies. The domain-agnostic angle
 *   and neuroscience grounding differentiates from every LLM wrapper.
 *
 * Tier 4 - Diversity-Thesis Alignment (lead with team + traction):
 * - Harlem Capital, Backstage Capital, Collab Capital, Precursor, MaC VC,
 *   Plexo Capital, Terri Burns, Sydney Sykes
 *   Lead with team (Black founders, Brown + MIT) AND traction (4 deployments,
 *   2 patents, 553k albums). These investors are tired of seeing diverse teams
 *   with thin products. CCX's depth is the differentiator.
 *
 * Tier 5 - University Networks (lead with alumni connection):
 * - Brown Angel Group, Van Wickle Ventures, Waterman Ventures, Cherrystone,
 *   MIT Alumni Angels (Boston + NYC), E14 Fund, Castor Ventures, Slater Fund
 *   These are warm-by-default. Activate Brown and MIT alumni networks.
 *   David Ebersman (Brown '91, Lyra Health founder) could be a bridge
 *   between university network and healthcare investor categories.
 *
 * EMAIL SUBJECT LINE SUGGESTIONS:
 * - For neuroscientists: "Yeo 7-network model meets production AI: 4 domains, 0 retraining"
 * - For music investors: "553k albums, 26 listener archetypes -- the cognitive layer music needs"
 * - For healthcare: "Behavioral drift detection from conversational data -- 2 patents"
 * - For platform investors: "Domain-agnostic cognitive AI: deployed across 4 verticals, no retraining"
 * - For diversity-thesis: "Black founders (Brown + MIT) building patented cognitive AI infrastructure"
 * - For alumni: "Fellow [Brown/MIT] alum building neuroscience-grounded AI -- would love 15 min"
